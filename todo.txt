Stuff to do

* prevent window scroll on arrow up/down when a list is open
* bug > enter won't select an item
* bug > when a dropdown list is filtered via the search feature, the arrow up/down keys try to highlight the non-visible elements
* add ability to style each LI individually, based on it's value attribute?
* key up/down doesn't work until search input field has focus first <- but do we need it now?
